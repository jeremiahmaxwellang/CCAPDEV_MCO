    <h1>Login</h1>

    <p>After registering properly, a visitor may log-in. Upon logging in, the option
        to reserve a slot will be open. The user is given the option to be
        “remembered” by the website. When the user chooses this option, every
        log in and visit to the website will extend their “remember” period by 3
        weeks.</p>
