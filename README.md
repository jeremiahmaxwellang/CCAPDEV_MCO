# Labyrinth: Lab Reservation System
This web application is developed as a requirement of CCAPDEV

# Project Overview:
This lab reservation system allows students to reserve seats in a desired computer laboratory.
Upon entering the homepage, the user must either register their DLSU account or login a
pre-existing account, before they can reserve lab slots. 

Once signed in, the student is redirected to the dashboard, where they can reserve slots
by selecting a lab from on a specific floor. Once the lab is selected, they must
enter the timeslot of when they will reserve the slots. A table will display which
slots are available (green) during the selected time. Unavailable red slots cannot
be reserved.
